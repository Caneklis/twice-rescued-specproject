    <p>The Dinos is an element of the Greek feasts, a vessel where wine and water were mixed (most often in proportions
      from 1:3 to 1:10). A large vessel with a round bottom was placed on a high stand. The wine was taken from it and
      distributed to the men - participants of night feasts (symposiasts). This vessel was created in the period of
      Orientalism (7th - beginning of 6th centuries BC), when Greece adopted many motifs and decorations from the East.
      These include sphinxes - winged lions with female heads. On the vessel there are two sphinxes depicted on the
      facade and reverse in the central panels and separated by a series of purple rays. These rays correspond to larger
      rays coming from the bottom of the vase. The middle part of the dinos is decorated with a triple belt of black and
      purple lines, which harmonizes well with the light, yellowish-cream finish of the vessel walls. The shape of the
      vase is elegant and modest, the pattern is distinguished by accuracy and sophistication.
    </p>
    <p><i>Conservation</i></p>
    <p>The vessel was assembled from numerous fragments which had to be cleaned of soot and dirt; the losses were filled
      and tinted. Originally, the dinos had two small handles, one of which was identified after the vessel was
      restored.
